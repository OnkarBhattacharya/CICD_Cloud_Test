## Requirements from Cloud Testing Market Research Document

Based on the provided PDF, the key requirements and deliverables are:

### 1. Market Analysis and Tool Survey
- Survey the market for relevant tools per test category (unit, component, integration, E2E, API, performance, security, accessibility).
- Provide short descriptions of each tool's role, strengths, and limitations.

### 2. Evaluation Criteria Definition
- Define comprehensive evaluation criteria for tools, including:
    - Functional coverage and depth
    - Developer experience (DX/maintainability, learning curve, local run parity, debugging support)
    - CI/CD integration (pipeline speed, caching/parallelization, artifacts/reports, container/K8s compatibility, Azure DevOps integration)
    - Stability and performance (test flakiness, runtime, resource usage)
    - Ecosystem & longevity (community size, release cadence, documentation quality)
    - Security & compliance (vendor trust, data handling, alignment with security standards)
    - Licensing & cost (open-source vs. commercial, TCO considerations)
    - Adoption risk (lock-in, migration paths, multi-language support)

### 3. Tool Comparison Matrix
- Assemble a comparison of the top 3-5 tools per category.
- Include pros/cons and usage scenarios for each tool.

### 4. Generic Test Strategy
- Draft a lightweight, generic test strategy illustrating how selected categories fit together in a typical cloud stack (frontend + backend + APIs).

### 5. Optional Proof of Concept (PoC)
- Prepare minimal code snippets or links to sample projects illustrating typical setups (no deep system integration required).

### 6. Deliverables
- Market overview document (slides or doc) summarizing test categories and notable tools.
- Evaluation matrix comparing leading tools per category with selection criteria.
- Suggested reference test strategy for a typical cloud system (frontend + backend + APIs).
- Appendices: glossary, research questions, and template matrices for future reuse.
- Optional: links to minimal PoCs or public examples demonstrating typical setups.
